= FeedValidator

FeedValidator is an interface to the {W3C Feed Validation online service}[http://validator.w3.org/feed/],
based on its SOAP 1.2 support. 

It helps to find errors in RSS or ATOM feeds.

FeedValidator add a new assertion (<code>assert_valid_feed</code>) which you can use in Rails applications.
This assertion implements a cache to improve the performance of the tests and to not abuse of the 
{W3C Feed Validation online service}[http://validator.w3.org/feed/]


== Examples

* For use FeedValidator just do this:

    require 'feed_validator'

    v = W3C::FeedValidator.new()
    v.validate_url('http://www.w3.org/QA/news.rss')
    puts v.to_s unless v.valid?

* In Rails you can use it in your functional tests, just modify your /test/test_helper.rb adding this line:

    require 'feed_validator/assertions'

  And now you can use in your functional test, in this way:

    def test_bar_valid_feed
      get :bar
      assert_valid_feed
    end

  Or use the class-level method to quickly create validation tests for a bunch of actions at once:

    assert_valid_feed :bar, :foo
